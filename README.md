# CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

> This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, 
diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, 
and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph 
search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial 
intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By course’s end, 
students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence 
principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.

# Summary

In this repo I designed and implemented various AI agents ranging from playing games using search algorithms, optimization 
and supervised learning to convolutional neural networks using TensorFlow for image processing as well as question 
answering using natural language processing.
